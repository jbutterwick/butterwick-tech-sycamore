# butterwick-tech-sycamore

This repo will act as a test bed for learning [Sycamore](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore), a library for creating reactive web apps in Rust and WebAssembly.

I'll be building this website with Sycamore in order to experiment with state of the art web technologies.
